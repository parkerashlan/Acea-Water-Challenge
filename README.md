# Acea-Water-Challenge

In this project I used the dataset by Acea about the Doganella Aquifer in Italy and predicted the depth to groundwater by using a Random Forest. I cleaned the data
using interpolation and selecting a time range which would yield the most accurate entries. I also tested for stationarity and trend by using the ADF and KPSS
statistical tests.
